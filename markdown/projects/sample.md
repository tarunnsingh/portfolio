Date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`, Do not override this format. Duplicate this same file-structure content for every other project(s) you have. Leave links `""` like this if there is no github / external link. Set `show: "true"` to `false` if you want to hide this specific project from showing. Also this is supposed to be the single line description for the project.
