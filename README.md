## 🚀 Quick Start

- `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- `yarn run dev` to start the development server.
- `yarn run build` build the files for production.
- `yarn run export` to use Next.js static exports.
- `yarn run serve` runs `build` and `export` commands at once.

## 🚨 Using the template with [CLI](https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/portfolio-cli)

Feel free to use this template to build your own portfolio site and deploy as static site to anywhere.

Use the [`abhijithvijayan-portfolio CLI`](https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/portfolio-cli) to generate template for your use.
